These scripts are created for private use and are theoretically only for the Streamlabs-Chatbot (maybe this work somewhere else, but I do not guarantee this)

# League
- you can set up your SummonerName + Riot Server

- (default Command "!elo") - display your League of Legends Rank (Solo - Flex) in Chat
- (default Command "!tft") - display your Teamfight Tactics (TFT) in Chat
- (default Command "!mastery) - display the x champs with the most points (x can be change in config)
- text overlay for OBS or something else (Solo, Flex, TfT, Mastery of the Top x champs)
- Stream, Discord and/or Both Chat
- setup the Query rate
- bad news, you need your own RIOT Games API key, the developer key only works for 24h, then you need a new key - but you can try to request a personal key [Riot Games Developer](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
- [Download League_All-in-One.zip](https://github.com/RzR32/streamlabs-chatbot-scripts/raw/master/League_All-in-One/League_All-in-One.zip)
##### Import Note! You must start the timer yourself, every time you start the bot - go to the Script Settings, under 'Query' and press the Button 'Start Checking'.

# Note
If you use the **Development Key**, you can enter this key for Lol & TfT ... but if you use the **Personal Key** you need one for LoL and another one for Tft
Unfortunately, this cannot be changed because a key is required for each app/game.
