These scripts are created for private use and are theoretically only for the Streamlabs-Chatbot (maybe this work somewhere else, but I do not guarantee this)

# League - TfT
- you can set up your SummonerName + Riot Server
- Customizable Command´s, Cooldown´s and Permission´s
- (default Command "!tft") - display your Teamfight Tactics (TFT) in Chat
- text overlay for OBS or something else (TfT)
- Stream, Discord and/or Both Chat
- setup the Query rate
- bad news, you need your own RIOT Games API key, the developer key only works for 24h, then you need a new key - but you can try to request a personal key [Riot Games Developer](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
- [Download League_Rank_TfT.zip](https://github.com/RzR32/streamlabs-chatbot-scripts/raw/master/Rank_TfT/Rank_TfT.zip)
##### One Import Note! You must start the timer yourself, every time you start the bot - go to the Script Settings, under 'Query' and press the Button 'Start Checking'.
