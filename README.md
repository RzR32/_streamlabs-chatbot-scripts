These scripts are created for private use and are theoretically only for the Streamlabs-Chatbot (maybe they work somewhere else, but I do not guarantee this)

As an alternative, I tried to make the script public on my [website](https://ryzox.de/League/) without using the script here ... unfortunately there are no commands about it, only intended for overlay.

# League
- you can setup your SummonerName + Riot Server
- Customizable Command´s, Cooldown´s and Permission´s
- (default Command "!elo") - display your League of Legends Rank in Solo, Flex & TFT in Chat
- (default Command "!mastery) - display the x champs with the most points (x can be change in config)
- text overlay for OBS or something else (Solo, Flex, TfT, Mastery of the Top x champs)
- Stream, Discord and/or Both Chat
- setup the Query rate
- bad news, you need your own RIOT Games API key, the developer key only works for 24h, then you need a new key - but you can try to request a personal key [Riot Games Developer](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
- [Download League.zip](https://github.com/RzR32/_streamlabs-chatbot-scripts/raw/master/League/League.zip)
##### One Import Note! You must start the timer yourself, everytime you start the bot - go to the Script Settings, under 'Query' and press the Button 'Start Checking'.

# Twitch
The Twitch v5 (kraken) API is deprecated and will be shutdown in the future.
In this case I have already made the Script in the newer Version (helix).
- you can setup your TwitchName
- dis- / enable Clips
    - (kraken) set the period: day, week, month or all
    - (helix) set the startup to check
    - limit 1 - 100
- dis- / enable Videos
    - dis- / enable Archive(old Stream), Upload(self explaining) or/and Broadcast(Highlight)
    - limit 1 - 100
- Stream, Discord and/or Both Chat
- setup the Query rate
- you just need your own Twitch API key [Twitch Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
- [Download Twitch.zip](https://github.com/RzR32/_streamlabs-chatbot-scripts/raw/master/Twitch/Twitch.zip)
