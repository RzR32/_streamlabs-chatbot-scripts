These scripts are created for private use and are theoretically only for the Streamlabs-Chatbot (maybe ther work somewhere else, but I do not guarantee this)

# Twitch
The Twitch v5 (kraken) API is deprecated and will be shutdown in the future.
In this case I have already made the Script in the newer Version (helix).
- you can setup your TwitchName
- dis- / enable Clips
    - set the period: day, week, month or all
    - limit 1 - 100
- dis- / enable Videos
    - dis- / enable Archive(old Stream), Upload(self explaining) or/and Broadcast(Highlight)
    - limit 1 - 100
- Stream, Discord and/or Both Chat
- setup the Query rate    
- you just need your own Twitch API key [Twitch Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console)
- [Download Twitch.zip](https://github.com/RzR32/_streamlabs-chatbot-scripts/raw/master/Twitch/Twitch.zip)
##### One Import Note! You must start the timer yourself, everytime you start the bot - go to the Script Settings, under 'Query' and press the Button 'Start Checking'.
